(done)setSelected should rise a tree node change event
(done)when group node is selected .. children are also selected .. then event tree node
    change events shud be raised
when checkbox is selected on tree ConfigHelper.setConfig() should be called
make config object from XML and also do necessary validations and selections ..
(done)vis-state should make config object when target is set .. and also
when target is changed .. config should be cleared to default state ..
the config tree should also be reset

        DisplayElements in config file.
            Actually display elements should not be in the config file as they
            have nothing related to the config.
            What to do about the probe position which is a config element ?

TODO:

1) Check how shapes have to be put in place
2) How to show instruments on the work panel
3) Check how shape zoom is done in JSkyCat
4) Check if the image is shown North up in FOVAST view
    - JSky shows it as per pixels .. It does not transform the image
5) Image WCS - does it have any effect on the way instrument layouts are shown ?
    - This is a simplistic assumption
    - Every image CCD have pixels
    - The charge accumulated on CCD pixels are put in FITS file as is
        - every pixel value is the FITS image pixel
    - WCS gives the transformation needed to map pixel x,y in FITS image to a point
      on sky (RA, DEC)
    - Depending on if the CCD plane effectively is parallel to the tangent of
      earth surface at the location or at an angle and if CCD North is parallel
      to celestial north or not the WCS info differs.
    - Even the scale (i.e arc-secs a pixel covers in different directions) also
      has a bearing on the


      Scale should not matter for us ..


        How to capture shape info

        <ShapesLibrary>

            //shows basic shape info
            <Shape type="<sometype>"
                    rotatable="true"
                    selectable="true"
                    resizable="true"
                    movable="true"
                     >
            </Shape>

            //shows info specific to a type of shape
            <Shape type="Rectangle">
            </Shape>

            //Should individual shape elements in a compound shape have
            //rotatable, selectable, resizable, movable constraints .. ???
            <Shape type="CompoundShape">
                //Shape elements as children.
            </Shape>
        </Shapes>

        We also have to capture dependency between shapes.
        For example in IRIS and Mobie if the detector shape rotates, then
            other shapes have to be rotated as well.

        For OIWFS probes, when probe detector is dragged probe arm, vignetting
        limits, normal limits also have to move along ... in here probe detector
        subshape can be marked as master among the shapes in the compound shape.

        How to tie display elements with config options ?
            - Should display elements and config options be in the same XML.
            - How to tie layout xml with display elements
            - How to tie display elements and config options

        Position in InstrumentControl.xml should have

        How would one configure an instrument
            - select one or more values from possible values for a config element
              (UI element : drop down select box or checkboxes or radio buttons)
            - choose one of two options
              (UI element: radio button)
            - simply select some setting
              (UI element: single checkbox)
            - there could be dependency between config elements ..
               i.e you can only configure one option if some other option is chosen
            - what to do if a certain option does not apply .. leave it blank or
              set it to its default value ?
