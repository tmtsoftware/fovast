TODO:

1) Check how shapes have to be put in place
2) How to show instruments on the work panel
3) Check how shape zoom is done in JSkyCat
4) Check if the image is shown North up in FOVAST view
    - JSky shows it as per pixels .. It does not transform the image
5) Image WCS - does it have any effect on the way instrument layouts are shown ?
    - This is a simplistic assumption
    - Every image CCD have pixels
    - The charge accumulated on CCD pixels are put in FITS file as is
        - every pixel value is the FITS image pixel
    - WCS gives the transformation needed to map pixel x,y in FITS image to a point
      on sky (RA, DEC)
    - Depending on if the CCD plane effectively is parallel to the tangent of
      earth surface at the location or at an angle and if CCD North is parallel
      to celestial north or not the WCS info differs.
    - Even the scale (i.e arc-secs a pixel covers in different directions) also
      has a bearing on the


      Scale should not matter for us ..

    <!--
        Every shape object will have the following properties
            outline, outlineColor, fill, fillColor
        Colors would be in hex format #rrggbbaa where aa indicates alpha between 
            0 and 255 (255 being opaque and 0 being transparent)
